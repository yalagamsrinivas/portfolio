# Project 1

• Currently Working on 3D object detection using Early Fusion(modified version of
Point Pillars Network) of LiDAR point cloud and 2D boxes of image.

• Implemented Point Pillars Pre and Post processing algorithms using both C++
and CUDA, optimized Keras model using TensorRT and integrated ONNX model to
Perception pipeline running on ZF ProAI,ROS is used as middle ware to subscribe
sensor data and Publish detected 3D boxes.

• Supported ZF’s Deep Neural Net Framework Feature improvements, training on
open shift platform and Docker images creation, converting open source 3d object
data set labels into ZF’s internal labelling format and adopted for training and
testing

# Project 2

• Analyzed different sensor modalities (RADAR, LiDAR, Camera) for improving Object
detection and tracking functionality, implemented multi sensor data fusion
and tracking algorithm for automated driving.

• Implemented Data Association using Nearest Neighbor, JPDA, and Cheap PDA
Methods, Multi Sensor Data Fusion using Optimal Fusion (Convex Combination)
and Covariance Intersection Data Fusion,various Kalman Tracking models like
Constant velocity, Constant Acceleration, and Constant Turn Models.


# Project 3

• Implemented Lane Detection algorithm using OpenCV and same re implemented
in C.

• Implemented various edge detection algorithms (Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt) ,Hough
Transform to detect lines and different Segmentation techniques.
